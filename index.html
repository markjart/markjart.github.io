			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<hr>

			<p>
			I was born on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day" target="_blank">April Fool's Day</a>, 1967, in <a href="http://ci.carbondale.il.us/" target="_blank">Carbondale, Illinois</a>, at 4:26 in the afternoon.&nbsp; I don't remember Carbondale because my parents moved to <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en.html" target="_blank">Chicago</a> before my long-term memory formed.&nbsp; My earliest memory is of me riding my spring-loaded rocking horse alone, watching a <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=8250a00140" target="_blank">Marlboro Man commercial</a> on TV.&nbsp; I seem to vaguely remember the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050022/" target="_blank">Gumby Show</a> too, so it may have been during that show.&nbsp; Richard Nixon signed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Health_Cigarette_Smoking_Act" target="_blank">The Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act</a> into law on April Fool's Day, 1970, which is why it went into effect on January 2, 1971.&nbsp; This means I was somewhere between 2 and 3 years old when my long-term memory kicked in to gear.&nbsp; I've been trying my damnedest to forget things ever since.
			</p>
			<p>
			Whilst we were living in the <a href="http://carl-sandburg.com/chicago.htm" target="_blank">"City of the Big Shoulders"</a>, my parents decided I was alone, and saw fit to give me a brother, Eric, so I would have someone to torture, er...I mean play with as a child.&nbsp; I'm not sure where they got him, but they assured me, they lost the receipt and couldn't return him<b>,</b> and I wasn't allowed to feed him to my dog, Baber <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IPA_for_English" target="_blank">(IPA: beɪbɜr)</a> - actually <em>Baby </em>so named by my parents, but I had trouble with my '<big><span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)">i'</span></big><big><span class="IPA" title="Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"> </span></big>sounds back then.
			</p>
			<p>
			Luckily, my parents had the good sense <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/" target="_blank">natural selection</a> gave them, so they high-tailed it out of the tiny po-dunk town of Chicago to the thriving metropolis of <a href="http://www.portarthur.net/" target="_blank">Port Arthur, Texas</a>, birthplace of <a href="http://www.janisjoplin.com/" target="_blank">Janis Joplin</a>.&nbsp; She wasn't home when we arrived.&nbsp; My fondest memory of Port Arthur was my first few weeks in school, where the teachers, not having heard a Chicago-born accent before, assumed I had a speech impediment and tried to place me with the special education class so my speech would get all <em>correctified like</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
			After a short stint in the social melange that was, and probably still is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle_%28Texas%29" target="_blank">Golden Triangle</a>, my folks up'd and moved us to <a href="http://www.houstontx.gov/" target="_blank">Houston</a>, where I spent my formative years, forming things what needed forming, like brain cells, bones, muscles, knowledge,  friendships, <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/index.php" target="_blank">political</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tao-Te-Ching-Lao-Tzu/dp/055334935X/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1291062609&amp;sr=1-3" target="_blank">philosophical</a> leanings, <a href="http://www.billhicks.com/" target="_blank">humor</a>, <a href="http://www.rothkochapel.org/" target="_blank">my love for art</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045061/" target="_blank">and movies</a>, <a href="http://www.lastconcert.com/" target="_blank">and music</a>, <a href="https://www.fitzlive.com/" target="_blank">and various other things</a> that got me into all sorts of mischief.
			</p>
			<p>
			Armed with mischievousness, and a want to get out of Houston, I was given a chance to move to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest" target="_blank">Pacific Northwest</a>, and spent a couple of years there, with <a href="http://www.cityoftacoma.org/" target="_blank">Tacoma, Washington</a> as my home port.
			</p>
			<p>
			A couple of years exploring up that ways gave me a longing for home, which for my heart, was <a href="http://www.traveltex.com/" target="_blank">Texas</a>, though my brain said, <em>Houston</em>, and so I returned.  I then spent several years working as a clerk for lawyers and then finally <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=get+your+shit+together" target="_blank"><em>congregated my fecal matter</em></a> and returned to school, where I earned my degree as an electronics technician in 1997.  Shortly thereafter, I took an opportunity from <a href="http://www.ni.com/" target="_blank">National Instruments</a> in Austin, and after 20 years working for them, with my last 10 of those years on the business side of their Web Commerce Team, I decided to further explore my love of web development and go back to school to learn coding. 			
			</p>
			<p>
			That's why I'm currently attending the <a href="https://techbootcamps.extendedcampus.utexas.edu/coding/" target="_blank">The Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin</a> and will complete to course in early April 2018.
